# Recursion Practice Problems

This repository contains code solutions written in JavaScript for some recursion problems.

Some of the JS files may include functions using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method as an alternative solution. (also practicing!)

I'm adding test files for each problem using Mocha JS test framework as I upload the solutions in GitHub.
